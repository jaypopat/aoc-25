My solutions for https://adventofcode.com/2025/
The aim is to improve my algorithmic problem solving and also try out some languages ive been wanting to use like go/kotlin so hopefully more of them alongside typescript (my go-to lang for algorithmic problems)
Maybe I finally pick up regex by doing these problems (highly unlikely)..
